## üìñ Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust machine learning model to predict the final sale price of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The model is based on a comprehensive dataset containing 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of the properties. The goal is to demonstrate a complete end-to-end data science workflow, from data exploration and cleaning to model interpretation and insight generation.

## üìä Dataset

The dataset is from the famous [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) Kaggle competition.
- **train.csv** - The training set (1460 observations)
- **test.csv** - The test set (1459 observations)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Manipulation & Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **Model Interpretation:** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## üìà Results and Insights

The XGBoost regression model was the top performer. Key drivers of house prices were found to be:
1.  **Overall Quality** of the property.
2.  **Above Ground Living Area** square footage.
3.  The **Neighborhood** of the property.
4.  The **Year the house was built** and the **Year the garage was built**.

SHAP value analysis was used to interpret the model's predictions and confirm these global feature importances.
